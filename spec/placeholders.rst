Bell Expressions placeholders
=============================

Two special Bell Expression placeholders can be used in decompositions or remarkable forms:

CanonicalExpression

    This placeholder has a single key ``index`` which references a canonical Bell expression in the canonical folder of a compendium.

OriginalExpression

    Used as a placeholder in the remarkable forms section, to reference the main Bell expression of the file.
